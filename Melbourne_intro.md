## Jack's thought dump on Melbourne													
### A brief intro to Melbourne
It took me 5 years in UK to realise how good Melbourne. Here are all the  thoughts I'd pass over to a traveller coming to Melbourne												
													
													
## To foreigners who got passed this													
### If you're thinking of visiting Australia, 												
go visit Sydney (better for short trips, you can only have so many coffees and meals a day in Melbourne)											
Go visit the great barrier reef - i hear its fantastic and unfortunately it's going away											
Go to New Zealand - there's a lot more to do in a lot less space. Food is less nice, but everything else is pretty awesome

### Melbourne is terrible for tourists because												
It's so far away from the rest of the world (but that has given it its flavour)
Everything outside the city is far away and requires a car

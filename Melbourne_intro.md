# Disclaimers
## To the Melbourians reading this 													
0. It's been a long time I've been in Melbourne, and this is merely one opinion
1. Make your own lists												
2. Tell me how to fix this list												
													
## Jack's thought dump on Melbourne													
### A brief intro to Melbourne
It took me 5 years in UK to realise how good Melbourne. Here are all the  thoughts I'd pass over to a traveller coming to Melbourne										
													
## To foreigners who got passed this													
### If you're thinking of visiting Australia, 												
go visit Sydney (better for short trips, you can only have so many coffees and meals a day in Melbourne)											
Go visit the great barrier reef - i hear its fantastic and unfortunately it's going away											
Go to New Zealand - there's a lot more to do in a lot less space. Food is less nice, but everything else is pretty awesome

### Melbourne is terrible for tourists because												
It's so far away from the rest of the world (but that has given it its flavour)
Everything outside the city is far away and requires a car 	

# For the British people reading this
## Specific notes for British people														
Cadbury dairy milk is not the same													
UK Cadbury is easily superior to Australian Cadbury												
	All the chip (crisp) packaging colours are different to the UK													
		Like inches and metres, there are no winners here.												
	pants are trousers. "you right?" is what store assistants ask when you look like you're in trouble 													
												
	Fish and chips is slighty different in the UK													
		Flake fish and chips cooked to order												
		The alternative to fish and chips is charcoal chicken - make sure you say yes to chicken salt												
	"How's it going?"  (AU) = "you right?" (UK)													
		"You right" is what a sales assistant in a shop asks when you look like you're having a problem												
	Driving is slightly more aggressive in Melbourne compared to UK													
		People seem to really be in a rush everywhere
